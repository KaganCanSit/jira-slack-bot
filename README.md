# ü§ñ Jira Slack Bot

This project is a Slack bot that integrates with Jira to manage tasks, bugs, stories, and epics. It allows users to create and manage tickets directly from Slack.

## üí¨ Sample Slack Conversation

> The following is an example of a conversation between two users in Slack using the bot and how they can create a bug ticket:

**John**: Hey Jane, I've noticed an issue with the login functionality. It seems to be failing when I try to login with my credentials.

**Jane**: That's strange, John. I just tested it and it seems to be working fine for me. Can you provide more details about the issue?

**John**: Sure, I'm getting a "Invalid Credentials" error even though I'm entering the correct username and password.

**Jane**: That's definitely not expected. Let's create a bug for this. 

**Jane**: `!bug Login functionality failing with valid credentials`

**SlackBot**: Bug ticket created with title "Login functionality failing with valid credentials". You can view the ticket [here](https://jira.example.com/browse/BUG-1234).

## üöÄ Features

The bot supports the following commands:

1. `!bug <title>` - Create a new bug ticket with the provided title.
2. `!story <title>` - Create a new story ticket with the provided title.
3. `!task <title>` - Create a new task ticket with the provided title.
4. `!epic <title>` - Create a new epic ticket with the provided title.
5. `!priority` - Get the list of questions to prioritize an issue.
6. `!inprogress <@USERID>` - Get the list of tasks that a user is currently working on.
7. `!time <ticket_id>` - Get the elapsed time for each state transition for a ticket.
8. `!help` - Get the list of commands you can use with me.

## ü§ù Integrating with Slack

### ü§ñ Creating a Slack Bot

To create a Slack bot, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click on the 'Create New App' button.
2. In the pop-up window, select 'From scratch', give your app a name, and select the workspace where you want to install the bot.
3. Once the app is created, go to the 'Bot Users' feature in the sidebar, click on 'Add a Bot User', and then 'Add Bot User' again to validate.
4. Install the app to your workspace. Go to the 'Install App' feature in the sidebar, and click on 'Install App to Workspace'. You will be redirected to your workspace's authorization page.
5. Authorize the app. Once authorized, you will be redirected back to the 'Install App' page, where you will find the 'Bot User OAuth Access Token'. This token is used to authenticate the bot in your code.

### üì° Setting Up Event Subscriptions

To use event subscriptions with this Slack bot, you need to configure your Slack app to send specific events to your bot's server. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to your app's configuration page on the Slack API website.
2. Click on 'Event Subscriptions' in the sidebar.
3. Toggle 'Enable Events' to 'On'.
4. In the 'Request URL' field, enter the URL of your server where the bot is running. This should be the URL followed by `/slack/events`, which is the endpoint in your `app.py` that Slack will send event data to. For example, if your server is running at `http://myserver.com`, you would enter `http://myserver.com/slack/events`.
5. Once you've entered the URL, Slack will send a challenge request to verify the server. Your server should respond to this challenge, which is already handled in your `app.py`.
6. In the 'Subscribe to Bot Events' section, click on 'Add Bot User Event'.
7. In the pop-up, select the 'message.channels' event. This event is triggered whenever a message is posted in a channel.
8. Click on 'Save Changes'.

Now, whenever a message is posted in a channel that the bot is a member of, Slack will send an event to your server. The server will then handle the event as defined in your `app.py`.

Remember to reinstall your app in your workspace after making these changes for them to take effect. You can do this from the 'Install App' page in your app's configuration.

### üîë Authorization Scopes

For the Slack bot to read messages in public and private channels and write messages, you need to add the following OAuth scopes to your Slack app:

- `channels:history`: This scope lets your app view messages and other content in public channels that your app has been added to.
- `groups:history`: This scope lets your app view messages and other content in private channels that your app has been added to.
- `chat:write`: This scope lets your app send messages as itself.

To add these scopes, follow these steps:

1. Go to your app's configuration page on the Slack API website.
2. Click on 'OAuth & Permissions' in the sidebar.
3. Scroll down to the 'Scopes' section.
4. In the 'Bot Token Scopes' subsection, click on 'Add an OAuth Scope'.
5. In the pop-up, select `channels:history`, `groups:history`, and `chat:write`.
6. Click on 'Save Changes'.

Remember to reinstall your app in your workspace after making these changes for them to take effect. You can do this from the 'Install App' page in your app's configuration.

### üåê Using NGROK for Local Development

When developing locally, you need a way to expose your local server to the internet so that Slack can send event data to it. [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/) is a tool that can create a secure tunnel to your localhost, making it accessible over the internet.

Here's how you can use NGROK for local development:

1. Download and install NGROK from the [official website](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Once installed, open a new terminal window and start NGROK on the same port as your local server by running the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```
Replace 5000 with the port number your local server is running on.  

NGROK will start and display a public URL (for example, http://12345678.ngrok.io). You can use this URL as the Request URL in your Slack app's event subscription settings.

Remember to update the Request URL in your Slack app's settings every time you restart NGROK, as a new public URL is generated each time.  With NGROK running, you can now receive events from Slack on your local development server.

## üìö Project Structure

- `app.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the Flask application and starts the server.

- `slack_message_handler.py`: This file contains the logic for handling incoming Slack messages and responding to them. It includes functions for each command that the bot supports (!bug, !story, !task, !epic, !priority, !inprogress, !time, !help).

- `slack_helper.py`: This file contains helper functions for interacting with the Slack API. It includes functions for sending messages, handling event subscriptions, and verifying requests from Slack.

- `jira_helper.py`: This file contains helper functions for interacting with the Jira API. It includes functions for creating tickets, getting the elapsed time for each state transition of a ticket, and getting the story size and priority of a ticket.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the project to run.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This project uses a `.env` file for configuration. This file should be located at the root of the project and should not be checked into version control. It is used to store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other environment-specific settings.

Here's a sample `.env` file:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your-slack-bot-token
JIRA_USER_EMAIL=your-jira-user_email
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token
JIRA_API_SERVER=your-jira-base-url
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=your-jira-project-key
SLACK_SERVER=your-slack-server
```
Replace the placeholders with the actual values for your project.

The `config.py` file in the project reads these environment variables and makes them available for use in the project. If any of these variables are not set, the application will not run correctly.

Remember to replace the placeholders with the actual environment variables your project uses.
