# Contributing to Jira Slack Bot

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Jira Slack Bot. It's people like you that make Jira Slack Bot such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [Issues](https://github.com/tarikguney/jira-slack-bot/issues) if there's already an open issue addressing your concerns. If not, feel free to [open a new one](https://github.com/tarikguney/jira-slack-bot/issues/new).

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-condense-index-logic
```

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Get the code

The first thing you'll need to do is get our code onto your machine. The easiest way to do this is to fork the repository.

## Create a branch

Changes should be made on your own branch. You can create a branch like this:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

## Make your changes

Make the changes you want to and write a clear, concise commit message describing the changes you made.

## Push your changes

Once you're satisfied with the changes you've made, push them to your branch:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

## Make a pull request

Go to your fork of the repository and make a pull request for your branch.

## Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

Your pull request will now go through some checks by our maintainers. If they suggest changes, make them and push them to your branch. If they don't suggest any changes, your pull request will be merged.

## What's next?

Once your pull request is merged, you can delete your branch. You can do this with a click of a button in the pull request interface.

You can now celebrate your contribution to Jira Slack Bot! You've earned it!
